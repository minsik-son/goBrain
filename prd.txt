## **4. User Flow & Experience**
### **4.1 Signup & Login Flow**
1. User visits the website and selects **Sign Up**.
2. They choose Google login or Email signup.
3. If signing up via Email, the system checks if the **IP has already been used**.
4. If IP is unique, the account is created; otherwise, they are blocked from multiple registrations.
5. After successful login, the user is redirected to the main translation page.

### **4.2 Translation Flow**
1. User enters text into the translation input box.
2. System checks:
   - **Character limit per request** (based on user plan)
   - **Request count per day** (IP/user-based limit)
3. If within limits, the system calls OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and returns the translation.
4. If limits are exceeded, an error message is displayed, suggesting an upgrade.
5. If the user is **Pro or Premium**, their requests are processed accordingly.

### **4.3 Subscription & Payment Flow**
1. User clicks **Upgrade to Pro/Premium**.
2. They are redirected to **Stripe Checkout**.
3. After payment, Stripe **triggers a webhook** that updates the user’s subscription plan in Supabase.
4. User is redirected back to the app with **increased translation limits**.
